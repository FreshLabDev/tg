# Release Process

Every Asterfield repository releases the same way. This document is identical in
all of them; only the verification section is specific to tg.

See [`versioning.md`](versioning.md) for what the numbers mean and why
pre-releases are tagged on `dev` and stable versions on `main`.

## The changelog is the release notes

`CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth for history, and the release workflow reads
it directly — the GitHub Release body is the `## <tag>` section, copied verbatim.
There is no second place to write release notes, and no step where the two can
disagree.

Which means the changelog has to be written for somebody else to read:

- Put unreleased changes under `## Unreleased`, in the section that fits:
  `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`, `Breaking`,
  `Known Limitations`.
- Record what matters to a user, an operator, or the next person deciding
  whether to upgrade. Not every refactor.
- Say what changed and why it mattered, concretely. "Fixed a bug" tells nobody
  anything.
- Call out anything an operator must act on — a new or renamed environment
  variable, a migration, a changed deployment assumption — explicitly, in its
  own entry.
- Exactly one `## Unreleased` section, always at the top. Two of them means the
  next release renames the wrong one.

## Publishing a pre-release

A pre-release is tagged on `dev`. Nothing merges anywhere.

1. Finish the work on `dev` and run the verification below.
2. Rename `## Unreleased` to the version, and open a fresh empty `## Unreleased`
   above it:

   ```text
   ## Unreleased

   ## v1.2.3-alpha.4 - 2026-09-09
   ```

3. Commit that on `dev` and push it.
4. Tag the pushed commit and push the tag:

   ```sh
   git tag -a v1.2.3-alpha.4 -m "v1.2.3-alpha.4"
   git push origin dev
   git push origin v1.2.3-alpha.4
   ```

The tag push runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-runs the checks,
refuses the tag if it is not on `dev` or has no changelog section, builds and
publishes the image, and creates the GitHub Release marked as a pre-release.

Then point the test bot at it. A pre-release nobody ran is a pre-release that
proved nothing.

## Publishing a stable release

A stable version is tagged on `main`, on the merge commit.

1. The version being promoted should already have been through at least one
   pre-release that actually ran somewhere. If it has not, say why in the
   changelog.
2. On `dev`, rename `## Unreleased` to the stable version and push.
3. Merge into `main` with a merge commit, so the tag has something to sit on:

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff dev
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:

   ```sh
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

5. Deploy it, and check the running version says what it should.

## Rolling back

Do not retag and do not delete a published release. Roll back by deploying the
previous version — the images are pinned by digest, so the previous digest is
the whole rollback — and then publish a new patch that fixes what went wrong.

A version that was published is a fact about what existed. Rewriting it makes
every other record of it wrong.

## Deploying

Nothing. tg is a library — it has no container, no stack and no host.

It reaches production when a bot bumps its dependency and that bot is deployed,
which means a change here is only as proven as the bots that have shipped on it.
That is why the stage names in [`versioning.md`](versioning.md) are about the
consumers rather than about this repository: `beta` means every bot has been
moved and none of them broke.

After tagging, a consumer picks it up with:

```sh
go get github.com/FreshLabDev/tg@<tag>
go mod tidy
```

The module proxy caches a tag permanently on first fetch, so a tag cannot be
taken back or moved. That is also why the release workflow refuses a tag that is
not on the branch its channel publishes from — by the time anyone notices, the
wrong version is already immutable.

## Verification

```sh
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
gofmt -l .
go mod verify
govulncheck ./...
```

Tests are httptest-based and hermetic: no test may reach the network, and the
suite must stay under a second.

For `beta` and stable: every consumer — branchy, makeitMD, searchy, voicy --
builds and passes its own suite against the new version, and at least one of
them has run on it against live Telegram.
